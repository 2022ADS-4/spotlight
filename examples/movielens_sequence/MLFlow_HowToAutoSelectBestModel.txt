MLFLOW documentation summary: How can we automatically save the best model

One can access the experiments not only via the UI, but also via mlflow.client:

The search_run, search_experiments, search_model_versions etc. functions have a parameter "order_by".
This parameter can be used to order by the metricS of choice.
This should be especially useful with search_run, order by mean_mmr_inverse, then order by mean_mrr.
It is possible to decide whether I wan to order ascending or decending!

Test and adapt the following pseudo-code:

from mlflow import MlflowClient
client=MlflowClient()
runs = client.search_runs(experiment_id, order_by="metrics.meanmrr_inv ASC"

choose run [0].

This pseudo-code does not work, because runs is a wrapped list, where indexing does not work.
However, the following works:

from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient
client = MlflowClient()
runs = client.search_runs(experiment_id, order_by=["metrics.mean_invmrr ASC"])	## note that we use mlflow.search_runs
df = mlflow.search_runs([experiment_id], order_by=["metrics.mean_invmrr ASC"])  ## instead of client.search_runs
run = client.get_run(best_run_id)
run	# returns the best run!
best_run_id = df.loc[0,'run_id']
